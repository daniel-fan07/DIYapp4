Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to help a user determine for another person whether they are experiencing a stroke or not. 
 
Known Issues:
While the FASTER acroymn has been proven to diagnose many cases of stroke and get patients to the help that they need across the US, there is always a more accurate 
basis to which a stroke can be identified in a hospital setting (vitals for example) rather than strictly observing physical symptoms.
